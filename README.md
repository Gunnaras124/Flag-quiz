# Flag-quiz
🎌 Flag-Fu: Turtle Edition
Like GeoGuessr, but way more pixelated and full of turtles.

🐢 What Even Is This?
This is not your average game.
This is Flag-Fu, the ultimate test of your geographical knowledge and patience as a turtle draws a flag slower than your grandma's Wi-Fi.

You get:

Flags.

Questions.

Turtles.

Existential crises when you mix up Austria and Latvia.

🕹️ How It Works
The turtle picks a random flag from a selection of 12 glorious nations.

It painstakingly draws it—rectangle by rectangle, pixel by pixel.

You stare, wait, and eventually type the name of the country.

Get it right? +1 point.
Get it wrong? -1 life. Feel bad. Reflect.

You get 5 lives.
You need 11 points to win.
Why 11? Don’t question the turtle.

🎯 Countries Included
Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Poland.
(Yes, we know some of these look identical. That's the point. We want you to suffer.)

📦 Requirements
Python 3.x

A functional keyboard

A deep respect for the turtle module

Optional: a coffee while the flags draw

💀 How To Lose
Be geographically challenged.

Type "germoney" instead of "germany".

Think the red-white-blue tricolor is only France.

🏆 How To Win
Guess 11 flags correctly without losing all 5 lives.
If you win, the turtle writes "You won".
No party. No parade. Just inner peace.

🚫 How To Cheat
You could just peek at the source code.
But the turtle knows.
The turtle sees all.
And it judges you silently.

🔚 Final Words
This game:

Builds character

Destroys confidence

Teaches you flags (sort of)
